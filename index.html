Police have access via IMSI-catchers. Some apps have remote microphone access. What to do? Leave your phone at home, use burner phones, use a Faraday pouch, cut your mic.	You can always mitiage risk by knowing your settings and making the right choices fo you.

			<section>
				<!--47-->
					<aside class="notes">
					Threat models are a way to think about what information you need to protect and how you are going to protect it. If we are talking about people and data about them, we often use the term Personally Identifiable Information or PII. PII is info that can identify individual people. It can do this by itself or in combinations with other info. When you think about what you collect, or who you share it with, think about PII which is sensitive information. Protecting it is important! But back to threat models. There are some questions you can ask to help clarify your threat model.
							1) What do you want to protect?
							2) Who do you want to protect if from?
							3) How likely is it that you will need to protect it?
							4) How bad are the consequences if you fail?
							5) Houw much trouble are you willing to go through to prevent the consequences?
						Exercise 2:
							"Let's answer these questions for ourselves... "
						Exercise 3
							Break into groups and think about sample patron threat models

This issue is bigger than libraries. If we are heading towards climate disaster does that mean we just shrug our shoulders?
