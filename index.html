Librarians and other information workers support and participate in transparency so that the workings of government, administration and business are opened to the scrutiny of the general public. They also recognize that it is in the public interest that misconduct, corruption and crime be exposed by what constitute breaches of confidentiality by so-called ‘whistleblowers’.</aside>

					<aside class="notes">Internet tracking. Between April 30 and August 17, I visited 401 sites and 1053 third party sites. Notice the third party sites. That's nearly two and half times the sites I actually saw in my browser window. One study found 55% of website load time was loading third party trackers.</aside>

					<aside class="notes">Thanks to EU's GDPR (General  Data Protection Regulation) we know that Spotify collects every click, what headphones you use, window size, what files you dropped and dropped. It is not a music playing machine. It is a recording machine. This is the desktop app. If we consider the same data collection on via phone app, it also knows where you are at the times, when you sleep, if your moving fast and slow, etc. Your phone is literally an extention of yourself and we are all, no joke, cyborgs. That is a different talk.</aside>

				<section>
					<aside class="notes">Facebook is always watching you. Even when you are not on Facebook. Non-PII can be reverse engineered via the mosaic effect. Academic studies have shown this for years. If this wasn't the case, Facebook would have no reason to track you when you don't use their site.</aside>

					<h3>What's <span style="color: gold">bad</span> about it?</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<aside class="notes">You get a bunch of crappy ads. These are annoying and distracting, but if you walk near a hotdog stand you want a notification that hotdogs are on sale right?. Sure. What if  the same scenario was framed as "yes, I will give away my Constitutional 4th amend rights, the rights that made the U.S. the envy of world, to see an ad for hotdogs." What if it was framed as a total 180 of the ethical values that seperated us from Soviet bloc totalritarianism, so you can get ads about about caulking if you watching a video about how to retile your bathroom? This what "personalization" means: total surveillence so you can get ads.</aside>
					<img src="images/ads.png"></img>
				</section>

				<section>
					<aside class="notes">Most malware comes from ads. More sinister are phishing attacks that lead to data breaches or doxing. Hey give us your email? Everytime you do this you expose yourself to more phishing attempts. Types harm that can come from privacy violations: identity theft, medical identity theft, doxing (blackmail, sextortion, swatting), stalking / partner abuse. Which is to say nothing of the qualitive costs: social isolation, emotional costs.</aside>

				<section>
					<aside class="notes">Nation-state scale psyops; e.g., targeted disinformation campaigns to manipulate elections. My mother is a white, working class voter with a relatively low education level in western PA. She was real hot commodity during the last presidential election. More about my mother later, but I should note Cambridge Analytica got their data in a clandestine manner, and we know about it because of a whistle blower.</aside>
					<img src="images/redzuck.png"></img>
				</section>

				<section>
					<aside class="notes">Reverse redlining. This when you deliberately target people in geographic region. The most notorious example was during the subprime mortage crisis when bad loans were heavily pushed at particular neighborhoods. Mosiac effect can be used to reverse engineer non-PII. You can learn someone's sex, gender, race, political affiliation, income, health info. This can lead to employment, housing, and education discrimination directly or indirectly. In short, all reasons we don't record what people read.</aside>
					<img src="images/redline.png"></img>

				<section>
					<aside class="notes">We respect our patrons privacy a lot but vendors really don't. Or to put it another way, we have crappy vendor contracts. Look at this one here. They can do whatever they want with your data. This one goes on to say it will track you even when you are not signed in. Products created specifically for libraries are little better, but they still broadly define non-PII which in then often shared+ with third parties.</aside>

					<h5>public nets</h5><aside class="notes">Perhaps these would be better called "public nets." People use our internet. If your software is not configured properly your computers are just fly traps for patron info. It is often the most vulernable that use our computers. This is a double whammy.</aside>
					<img src="images/trollpclab.png"></img>

				<section>
					<h5>more public nets</h5><aside class="notes">So we often utilize "free" services, and they are free just because they are fly traps for info.</aside>
